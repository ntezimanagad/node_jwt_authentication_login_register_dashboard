# node_jwt_authentication_login_register_dashboard

🔐 Auth Dashboard App (Node.js + React + JWT)
This is a full-stack authentication system built with React on the frontend and Node.js/Express on the backend. It features JWT-based authentication, allowing users to register, log in, and access a protected dashboard. This project was built during my learning process to understand secure user authentication and protected routing in web applications.

🔧 Features
📝 User registration and login system

🔐 Authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

🔒 Protected routes and user dashboard

🔁 Token-based session handling (access + refresh if included)

🌐 Responsive frontend with clean UI

📁 Organized folder structure with reusable components and routes

🛠 Tech Stack
Frontend: React, React Router, Axios

Backend: Node.js, Express.js, bcryptjs, jsonwebtoken

Database: MongoDB / MySQL (update with yours)

Tools: Postman, VS Code, npm

🎯 Purpose
This project was created to practice implementing secure, token-based authentication in a full-stack app. It helped me understand:

Password hashing and token generation

Managing access to protected routes

Storing and verifying JWT tokens

Building clean and responsive dashboards

🚀 Future Improvements
Add user role-based access (Admin, User)

Integrate a UI library (like Material UI or Tailwind CSS)

Store refresh tokens securely and handle logout properly

Add profile editing and password reset features
